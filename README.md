The "Hydroflotater" is a modular, semi-batch fluidized bed flotation device designed for the efficient, small-scale extraction of critical minerals like lithium and rare earth elements.
It features a compact, sensor-integrated design that allows for automated control and precise monitoring of air and water velocity, ensuring higher recovery rates while reducing energy 
and capital costs by 30%. Environmentally, the system stands out by operating without chemical frothers or reagents, facilitating efficient water reuse and sustainable on-site processing 
of newly discovered ore deposits. The product targets mining companies, SMEs, and research institutions, offering a low-sample testing requirement of just 1–2 kg compared to the traditional 25 kg.

As the project scales toward commercialization, future developments aim to integrate AI solutions and expand into environmental recovery fields such as e-waste flotation.
